CHEST PAIN - EMERGENCY TRIAGE PROTOCOL
========================================
Version: 2.1 | Last Updated: 2025-11-01

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
Chest pain is one of the most common emergency presentations. Rapid triage is
critical because acute coronary syndrome (ACS) requires time-sensitive treatment.
The door-to-balloon target for STEMI is <90 minutes.

2. RED FLAGS (Requires Immediate Emergency Triage)
---------------------------------------------------
The following findings indicate possible acute coronary syndrome or other
life-threatening cause:
  - Pain radiating to left arm, jaw, neck, or back
  - Diaphoresis (profuse sweating unrelated to exertion)
  - Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
  - Nausea or vomiting accompanying chest pain
  - Pain described as "pressure", "squeezing", or "crushing"
  - Pain severity ≥7/10
  - History of cardiac disease or multiple cardiac risk factors
  - Syncope or near-syncope with chest pain
  - Hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia)

3. TRIAGE LEVELS
-----------------

LEVEL 1 - EMERGENCY (Red):
  Criteria: Any 2+ red flags present, OR pain with hemodynamic instability
  Action: Activate cardiac catheterization lab, 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes
  Timeframe: Immediate assessment, target door-to-ECG <10 min
  Suspected: STEMI, Unstable Angina, Aortic Dissection, Pulmonary Embolism

LEVEL 2 - URGENT (Orange):
  Criteria: 1 red flag present, OR atypical chest pain with cardiac history
  Action: ECG within 30 minutes, serial troponins, continuous monitoring
  Timeframe: Assessment within 30 minutes
  Suspected: NSTEMI, Stable Angina, Pericarditis

LEVEL 3 - ROUTINE (Green):
  Criteria: No red flags, reproducible on palpation, pleuritic, positional
  Action: Standard workup, chest X-ray if indicated
  Timeframe: Assessment within 2 hours
  Suspected: Musculoskeletal, GERD, Costochondritis, Anxiety

4. KEY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
----------------------------
  Q1: Where exactly is the pain? Does it radiate anywhere?
  Q2: When did it start? What were you doing?
  Q3: How would you describe the pain? (sharp, dull, pressure, burning)
  Q4: Rate severity on 1-10 scale
  Q5: Do you have sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath?
  Q6: Have you had heart problems before?
  Q7: Do you take any heart medications?

5. RECOMMENDED TESTS BY TRIAGE LEVEL
--------------------------------------
  Emergency: 12-lead ECG, Troponin (stat), CBC, BMP, Coagulation, CXR
  Urgent: ECG, Serial Troponins (0h and 3h), CBC, BMP
  Routine: ECG (if not done), CXR if indicated

6. TIME-SENSITIVE ACTIONS
--------------------------
  - STEMI: Door-to-balloon <90 min (PCI) or door-to-needle <30 min (thrombolytics)
  - NSTEMI: Risk stratification within 24 hours
  - Aortic Dissection: CT angiography STAT, surgical consult
  - Pulmonary Embolism: CT pulmonary angiography, anticoagulation
