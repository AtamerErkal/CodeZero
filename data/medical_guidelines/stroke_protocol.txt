STROKE - EMERGENCY TRIAGE PROTOCOL
====================================
Version: 2.0 | Last Updated: 2025-10-15
Source: Adapted from AHA/ASA Stroke Guidelines 2024

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
Stroke is a medical emergency where rapid assessment and treatment are critical.
The therapeutic window for IV thrombolysis (tPA) is 4.5 hours from symptom onset.
Mechanical thrombectomy may be performed up to 24 hours in select patients.
"Time is brain" — approximately 1.9 million neurons die every minute during a stroke.

2. FAST ASSESSMENT (Primary Screening Tool)
---------------------------------------------
  F - FACE: Ask the person to smile. Does one side droop?
  A - ARMS: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one drift downward?
  S - SPEECH: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is speech slurred?
  T - TIME: Record the exact time symptoms were first noticed.

  ANY positive finding on FAST → Suspected Stroke → EMERGENCY

3. RED FLAGS (Immediate Emergency Triage)
------------------------------------------
  - Sudden onset of any neurological deficit
  - Facial asymmetry (unilateral drooping)
  - Unilateral arm or leg weakness
  - Slurred speech or inability to speak
  - Sudden severe headache ("worst headache of my life")
  - Sudden vision loss or double vision
  - Sudden confusion or altered consciousness
  - Loss of balance or coordination
  - Known time of onset within 4.5 hours (thrombolysis candidate)

4. TRIAGE LEVELS
-----------------

LEVEL 1 - EMERGENCY (Red):
  Criteria: Any positive FAST finding, OR sudden severe headache with
            neurological symptoms, OR known onset <4.5 hours
  Action: Stroke code activation, CT head STAT, neurology consult
  Timeframe: Door-to-CT <25 minutes, Door-to-needle <60 minutes
  Suspected: Ischemic Stroke, Hemorrhagic Stroke, TIA

LEVEL 2 - URGENT (Orange):
  Criteria: Transient symptoms that have resolved, OR onset >4.5 hours,
            OR uncertain time of onset
  Action: CT head within 1 hour, MRI if available, neurology assessment
  Timeframe: Assessment within 30 minutes
  Suspected: TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack), Completed Stroke

LEVEL 3 - ROUTINE (Green):
  Criteria: Chronic stable neurological symptoms, history of prior stroke
            with no new deficits, headache without neurological signs
  Action: Outpatient neurology referral, risk factor assessment
  Timeframe: Assessment within 2 hours
  Suspected: Migraine, Chronic Neurological Condition

5. KEY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
----------------------------
  Q1: When did the symptoms start? What time exactly?
  Q2: Can you smile? Is your face symmetrical?
  Q3: Can you raise both arms and hold them up for 10 seconds?
  Q4: Can you say "The sky is blue" clearly?
  Q5: Do you have a sudden severe headache?
  Q6: Do you have vision problems (blurry, double, or lost vision)?
  Q7: Are you on blood thinners or have you had a recent stroke?

6. RECOMMENDED TESTS BY TRIAGE LEVEL
--------------------------------------
  Emergency: CT Head (non-contrast STAT), CT Angiography, CBC, BMP,
             Coagulation (INR/PT/PTT), Blood Glucose, Type & Screen
  Urgent: CT Head, MRI Brain, Carotid Doppler, Echo
  Routine: Outpatient MRI, Risk factor labs (lipids, HbA1c)

7. TIME-SENSITIVE ACTIONS
--------------------------
  - IV tPA: Administer within 4.5 hours of symptom onset
  - Mechanical Thrombectomy: Within 24 hours for large vessel occlusion
  - Blood Pressure: Maintain <185/110 before tPA
  - Blood Glucose: Correct hypoglycemia immediately
  - Hemorrhagic Stroke: Reverse anticoagulation, neurosurgery consult
