DIABETIC EMERGENCY - TRIAGE PROTOCOL
======================================
Version: 1.5 | Last Updated: 2025-09-20

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
Diabetic emergencies include Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), Hyperosmolar
Hyperglycemic State (HHS), and Severe Hypoglycemia. These conditions can be
rapidly fatal without prompt treatment. DKA mortality is 1-5% when treated
appropriately but rises to >50% if untreated.

2. RED FLAGS (Immediate Emergency Triage)
------------------------------------------
  DKA Indicators:
  - Known diabetes + nausea/vomiting + abdominal pain
  - Rapid deep breathing (Kussmaul respiration)
  - Fruity breath odor
  - Altered mental status with known diabetes
  - Blood glucose >250 mg/dL (if known) + symptoms

  HHS Indicators:
  - Elderly patient with type 2 diabetes
  - Severe dehydration signs (dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor)
  - Blood glucose >600 mg/dL (if known)
  - Altered consciousness or seizures

  Severe Hypoglycemia Indicators:
  - Blood glucose <54 mg/dL (if known)
  - Confusion, seizures, or loss of consciousness in diabetic patient
  - Inability to self-treat (cannot eat or drink)
  - Unresponsiveness in known diabetic

3. TRIAGE LEVELS
-----------------

LEVEL 1 - EMERGENCY (Red):
  Criteria: Altered mental status + diabetes, OR suspected DKA/HHS,
            OR hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness or seizures
  Action: IV access, stat glucose, ABG, BMP, fluid resuscitation
  Timeframe: Immediate assessment and treatment
  Suspected: DKA, HHS, Severe Hypoglycemia

LEVEL 2 - URGENT (Orange):
  Criteria: Known diabetes with persistent vomiting, moderate dehydration,
            blood glucose >300 mg/dL with mild symptoms, or hypoglycemia
            not responding to oral glucose
  Action: IV fluids, glucose monitoring q1h, BMP, ketone check
  Timeframe: Assessment within 30 minutes
  Suspected: Moderate DKA, Hyperglycemic Crisis

LEVEL 3 - ROUTINE (Green):
  Criteria: Known diabetes with mildly elevated glucose but alert and stable,
            hypoglycemia that responds to oral treatment, routine diabetes
            management questions
  Action: Glucose check, medication review, diabetes education
  Timeframe: Assessment within 2 hours
  Suspected: Uncontrolled Diabetes, Medication Adjustment Needed

4. KEY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
----------------------------
  Q1: Do you have diabetes? Type 1 or Type 2?
  Q2: What is your current blood sugar if known?
  Q3: When did you last eat? When was your last insulin or medication?
  Q4: Do you have nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
  Q5: Are you feeling confused or drowsy?
  Q6: Have you been drinking enough fluids? Are you urinating more than usual?
  Q7: Have you had any recent illness, infection, or surgery?

5. RECOMMENDED TESTS BY TRIAGE LEVEL
--------------------------------------
  Emergency: Stat Glucose, ABG, BMP (Na, K, Cl, CO2, BUN, Cr), Ketones
             (serum + urine), CBC, Lactate, Serum Osmolality, Urinalysis
  Urgent: Glucose, BMP, Ketones, Urinalysis, HbA1c
  Routine: Glucose, HbA1c, BMP, Urinalysis

6. TIME-SENSITIVE ACTIONS
--------------------------
  DKA:
  - IV Normal Saline bolus 1-1.5 L in first hour
  - Insulin infusion after potassium confirmed ≥3.3 mEq/L
  - Potassium replacement as needed
  - Monitor glucose hourly, BMP every 2-4 hours

  HHS:
  - Aggressive fluid resuscitation (may need 6-9L total)
  - Gradual glucose reduction (avoid rapid correction)
  - Monitor serum osmolality

  Severe Hypoglycemia:
  - IV Dextrose 50% (D50) 25-50 mL immediately
  - Glucagon 1 mg IM if no IV access
  - Recheck glucose every 15 minutes
  - Identify and address underlying cause
