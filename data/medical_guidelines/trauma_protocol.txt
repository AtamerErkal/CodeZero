====================================

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
Trauma is the leading cause of death in persons aged 1-44 years. The "golden hour"
concept emphasizes that definitive treatment within the first 60 minutes of injury
significantly improves survival. Pre-hospital triage identifies patients who need
trauma center care versus those who can be treated at community hospitals.

2. RED FLAGS (Immediate Emergency Triage)
------------------------------------------
  Mechanism of Injury (High Energy):
  - Motor vehicle crash >30 mph or with ejection
  - Pedestrian or cyclist struck by vehicle
  - Fall from >3 meters (10 feet)
  - Penetrating injury to head, neck, torso, or proximal extremities
  - Blast injury or explosion
  - Crush injury

  Physiological Signs:
  - GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) ≤13
  - Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg
  - Respiratory rate <10 or >29 breaths/min
  - Uncontrolled external hemorrhage
  - Penetrating wound to chest or abdomen
  - Flail chest or multiple rib fractures
  - Pelvic instability
  - Bilateral femur fractures
  - Amputation proximal to wrist or ankle

3. TRIAGE LEVELS
-----------------

LEVEL 1 - EMERGENCY (Red):
  Criteria: High-energy mechanism + any physiological red flag, OR penetrating
            injury to torso, OR GCS ≤13, OR hemodynamic instability
  Action: Trauma team activation, ABCDE assessment, massive transfusion
          protocol on standby, CT trauma series
  Timeframe: Immediate
  Suspected: Major Trauma, Internal Hemorrhage, Traumatic Brain Injury

LEVEL 2 - URGENT (Orange):
  Criteria: Moderate mechanism (fall <3m, low-speed MVC) with isolated injury,
            OR significant pain with stable vitals, OR extremity deformity
  Action: Focused assessment, X-rays of affected area, pain management
  Timeframe: Assessment within 30 minutes
  Suspected: Fractures, Dislocations, Moderate Soft Tissue Injury

LEVEL 3 - ROUTINE (Green):
  Criteria: Low mechanism (ground-level fall, minor blunt trauma), no red flags,
            stable vitals, alert and oriented, isolated minor injury
  Action: Physical exam, X-ray if indicated, wound care
  Timeframe: Assessment within 2 hours
  Suspected: Sprains, Strains, Contusions, Minor Lacerations

4. KEY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
----------------------------
  Q1: What happened? How were you injured? (Mechanism of injury)
  Q2: Where does it hurt? Can you point to the area?
  Q3: Can you move all your arms and legs normally?
  Q4: Did you lose consciousness at any point?
  Q5: Are you having difficulty breathing?
  Q6: Is there any bleeding that you cannot stop?
  Q7: Are you taking blood thinners or have any bleeding disorders?

5. ABCDE PRIMARY SURVEY (Pre-Hospital Assessment)
---------------------------------------------------
  A - Airway: Is the airway clear? Can the patient speak?
  B - Breathing: Is breathing normal? Any chest injuries?
  C - Circulation: Is there major bleeding? Pulse present?
  D - Disability: What is the GCS? Pupil response?
  E - Exposure: Any other injuries? Temperature (hypothermia risk)?

6. RECOMMENDED TESTS BY TRIAGE LEVEL
--------------------------------------
  Emergency: FAST ultrasound, CT Head/C-Spine/Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis,
             CBC, Type & Crossmatch, BMP, Coagulation, Lactate, Blood Gas
  Urgent: X-rays of affected areas, CBC, BMP, Urinalysis
  Routine: X-rays if indicated, wound assessment

7. TIME-SENSITIVE ACTIONS
--------------------------
  - Hemorrhage Control: Direct pressure, tourniquet for extremity
  - Tension Pneumothorax: Needle decompression followed by chest tube
  - Massive Transfusion: Activate protocol for hemodynamic instability
  - TBI: Maintain MAP >80, avoid hypoxia and hypotension
  - Spinal Precautions: Maintain until cleared by imaging
  - Hypothermia Prevention: Warm fluids, remove wet clothing
