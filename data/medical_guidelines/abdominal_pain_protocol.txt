=============================================

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
Abdominal pain is one of the most frequent emergency department complaints,
accounting for approximately 8% of all ED visits. The differential diagnosis
is broad, ranging from benign conditions (gastritis, constipation) to
life-threatening emergencies (ruptured aortic aneurysm, bowel perforation).
Rapid triage is critical to identify surgical emergencies.

2. RED FLAGS (Immediate Emergency Triage)
------------------------------------------
  - Rigid or board-like abdomen (peritonitis)
  - Severe pain with hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension)
  - Signs of internal bleeding (pallor, dizziness, fainting)
  - Pulsatile abdominal mass (ruptured aortic aneurysm)
  - Fever >38.5°C with severe abdominal pain
  - Vomiting blood (hematemesis) or bloody/black stool (melena)
  - Severe pain in pregnant patient (ectopic pregnancy)
  - Sudden onset of severe pain ("10/10")
  - Abdominal pain following trauma
  - Known history of abdominal aortic aneurysm

3. TRIAGE LEVELS
-----------------

LEVEL 1 - EMERGENCY (Red):
  Criteria: Any 2+ red flags, OR rigid abdomen, OR hemodynamic instability,
            OR suspected ruptured AAA, OR hematemesis with unstable vitals
  Action: IV access x2, STAT labs, cross-match blood, surgical consult
  Timeframe: Immediate assessment
  Suspected: Ruptured AAA, Bowel Perforation, Ectopic Pregnancy, GI Hemorrhage

LEVEL 2 - URGENT (Orange):
  Criteria: 1 red flag present, OR moderate-severe pain with fever,
            OR suspected appendicitis, OR RUQ pain with jaundice
  Action: Labs, imaging (CT abdomen or ultrasound), IV fluids, pain management
  Timeframe: Assessment within 30 minutes
  Suspected: Appendicitis, Cholecystitis, Diverticulitis, Pancreatitis,
             Bowel Obstruction, Kidney Stone

LEVEL 3 - ROUTINE (Green):
  Criteria: No red flags, mild-moderate pain, stable vitals, eating/drinking
  Action: History, examination, basic labs if indicated
  Timeframe: Assessment within 2 hours
  Suspected: Gastritis, Gastroenteritis, Constipation, IBS, UTI

4. KEY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
----------------------------
  Q1: Where exactly is the pain? (Right upper, left upper, right lower,
      left lower, central, diffuse)
  Q2: When did it start? Was the onset sudden or gradual?
  Q3: How would you describe the pain? (Sharp, crampy, burning, dull)
  Q4: Rate the pain on a scale of 1-10
  Q5: Does the pain move or radiate anywhere?
  Q6: Do you have fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
  Q7: Have you noticed any blood in vomit or stool?
  Q8: Could you be pregnant? (if applicable)
  Q9: Have you had any recent abdominal surgery?

5. PAIN LOCATION GUIDE
------------------------
  Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ): Gallbladder, liver, bile duct
  Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ): Spleen, stomach, pancreas tail
  Right Lower Quadrant (RLQ): Appendix, right ovary, right ureter
  Left Lower Quadrant (LLQ): Sigmoid colon, left ovary, left ureter
  Epigastric (central upper): Stomach, pancreas, heart (referred)
  Periumbilical (around navel): Small bowel, early appendicitis, AAA
  Suprapubic (lower central): Bladder, uterus, prostate
  Diffuse: Peritonitis, bowel obstruction, mesenteric ischemia

6. RECOMMENDED TESTS BY TRIAGE LEVEL
--------------------------------------
  Emergency: CBC, BMP, Lipase, Lactate, Type & Cross, Coagulation,
             Pregnancy test, CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast STAT
  Urgent: CBC, BMP, Lipase, Liver function tests, Urinalysis,
          Pregnancy test, CT or Ultrasound as appropriate
  Routine: CBC, BMP, Urinalysis, Pregnancy test if applicable

7. TIME-SENSITIVE ACTIONS
--------------------------
  Ruptured AAA: Emergent vascular surgery, massive transfusion protocol
  Bowel Perforation: IV antibiotics, emergent surgical consult
  Ectopic Pregnancy: IV access, OB/GYN consult, possible emergent surgery
  GI Hemorrhage: IV PPI, GI consult, transfuse if Hb <7 g/dL
  Appendicitis: Surgical consult within 12 hours of diagnosis
  Bowel Obstruction: NPO, NG tube, surgical consult if complete obstruction
