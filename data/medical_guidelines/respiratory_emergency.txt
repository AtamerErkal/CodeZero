RESPIRATORY EMERGENCY - TRIAGE PROTOCOL
=========================================
Version: 1.3 | Last Updated: 2025-10-01

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
Respiratory emergencies include acute asthma exacerbation, COPD exacerbation,
pneumonia with respiratory failure, anaphylaxis with airway compromise, and
pulmonary embolism. Rapid assessment of respiratory status is critical as
hypoxia can lead to cardiac arrest within minutes.

2. RED FLAGS (Immediate Emergency Triage)
------------------------------------------
  - Inability to speak in full sentences (severe breathlessness)
  - Respiratory rate >30 or <8 breaths per minute
  - Use of accessory muscles (neck and shoulder muscles for breathing)
  - Cyanosis (blue lips or fingertips)
  - Oxygen saturation <90% (if known)
  - Stridor (high-pitched breathing sound on inspiration)
  - Sudden onset after exposure to allergen (anaphylaxis)
  - Chest pain with sudden dyspnea (pulmonary embolism)
  - Altered consciousness with breathing difficulty
  - History of intubation for asthma or COPD

3. TRIAGE LEVELS
-----------------

LEVEL 1 - EMERGENCY (Red):
  Criteria: Any 2+ red flags, OR inability to speak, OR cyanosis,
            OR stridor, OR suspected anaphylaxis
  Action: High-flow oxygen, nebulized bronchodilators, epinephrine if
          anaphylaxis, prepare for intubation
  Timeframe: Immediate assessment
  Suspected: Severe Asthma, Respiratory Failure, Anaphylaxis, PE

LEVEL 2 - URGENT (Orange):
  Criteria: Moderate breathlessness (can speak in short sentences),
            SpO2 90-94%, wheezing, 1 red flag present
  Action: Supplemental oxygen, bronchodilators, chest X-ray, ABG
  Timeframe: Assessment within 30 minutes
  Suspected: Moderate Asthma, COPD Exacerbation, Pneumonia

LEVEL 3 - ROUTINE (Green):
  Criteria: Mild breathlessness on exertion only, no red flags,
            SpO2 >94%, can speak in full sentences, stable vitals
  Action: Peak flow measurement, chest X-ray if indicated, medication review
  Timeframe: Assessment within 2 hours
  Suspected: Mild Asthma, Upper Respiratory Infection, Anxiety

4. KEY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
----------------------------
  Q1: Can you complete a full sentence without stopping to breathe?
  Q2: When did the breathing difficulty start? Was it sudden or gradual?
  Q3: Do you have asthma, COPD, or any lung disease?
  Q4: Were you exposed to anything before this started (allergens, smoke)?
  Q5: Do you have chest pain along with the breathing difficulty?
  Q6: Are your lips or fingers turning blue?
  Q7: Do you use an inhaler? When did you last use it?

5. RECOMMENDED TESTS BY TRIAGE LEVEL
--------------------------------------
  Emergency: ABG, CXR (portable), SpO2 monitoring, Peak Flow, CBC,
             BMP, Troponin (if PE suspected), CT-PA (if PE suspected)
  Urgent: SpO2, Peak Flow, CXR, CBC, BMP, Sputum Culture (if infection)
  Routine: Peak Flow, SpO2, CXR if indicated

6. TIME-SENSITIVE ACTIONS
--------------------------
  Severe Asthma:
  - Continuous nebulized salbutamol + ipratropium
  - IV magnesium sulfate 2g over 20 minutes
  - IV hydrocortisone 200mg or oral prednisolone 40-50mg
  - Consider IV aminophylline if no response

  Anaphylaxis:
  - IM Epinephrine 0.5mg (1:1000) into lateral thigh IMMEDIATELY
  - Repeat every 5-15 minutes if needed
  - High-flow oxygen, IV fluids for hypotension

  Pulmonary Embolism:
  - Anticoagulation (heparin) once confirmed
  - Thrombolysis for massive PE with hemodynamic instability
  - Consider catheter-directed therapy
